                        2002 Vintage<br>
                        Robert Wolfe/Owner: Oregon Pinot Noir Club/World Class Wines June 2004<br>
                        <small>"…the ’02 Christopher Bridge (Pinot Noir) is one of the finest new releases I’ve seen in some time, especially from a producer in this category (only 225 cases made.) The wine shows impressive concentration, with a nose and a palate of pure, ripe cherry. The wine is impeccably balanced, and as a result, slides across the palate like silk lingering for many seconds as the fruit-based finish continues to pump out flavor. This is the single most exciting new wine I’ve tried this year, and well worth the modest price tag. Drink, or hold for further development."</small>

                        Rory Olson/Owner: Portland Wine Merchants/Adventures in Wine March 2005<br>
                        <small>"As a follow-up to two notable vintages in the three year history of Christopher Bridge Pinot Noirs, they have crafted their first Reserve edition and this is comparable to many of the Oregon Burgundies that hit the $50 mark! Absolutely beautiful blast of ripe Pinot fruit in the nose. Black fruits, spice, coffee, toast, vanilla, and a nice touch of ripe black cherry. Super full and finishes super long. About as hedonistic as Pinot can get."</small>

                        <small>"The wine features dense fruits, berries and plums that spread out across the palate in waves. This is certainly a big, ripe wine from the ripe ’03 vintage, but it has real finesse to go along with the bold flavors. In other words, it has great balance and varietal flavors, factors that many ‘03s lack. The big fruit is already soft, generous and drinkable. The wine is balanced by a touch of ripe tannin and has perfectly balanced acidity to carry the flavors through a very lengthy finish. This is a terrific small-lot wine … worthy of acquisition."</small>

                        <small>"This estate, and its Satori Springs Vineyard, is owned by Christopher Carlberg and his wife Susanne. Carlberg is Chris Camarda’s (of Andrew Will Winery fame) brother-in-law, which goes a long way to explain why Camarda produces this Oregon Pinot Noir in his Vashon Island winery. Its waxy black fruit-scented nose leads to a medium bodied, spicy personality. This peppery wine reveals flavors of currants, raspberries and strawberries."

                        <small>"Chris and Susanne Carlberg’s estate Satori Springs Vineyard in the northern Willamette Valley combine with the winemaking of Chris Camarda of Andrew Will fame … to produce a classy example of Oregon Pinot Noir. This reveals aromas of bright cherries and sweet spices with just a hint of oak, followed by flavors of pomegranates, sweet cherries and black olives."

                        <small>Sourced from the "respected Satori Springs Vineyard …, this wine opens with aromas of raspberries, minerally earth and a hint of oak, followed by integrated flavors of cherries, rhubarb, pomegranates and sweet herbs." Rated 'Excellent'

                        <small>This PInot Noir was aged for 10 months in 15% new oak. Medium ruby-colored, it displays a perfume of cedar, spice box, assorted red fruits. On the palate it is medium-bodied, savory, well-balanced.  Drink this tasty effort over the next 5 years.  87 pts.
