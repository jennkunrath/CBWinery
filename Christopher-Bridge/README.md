Christopher Bridges Responsive Design Conversion

###Project Notes:

**Wishlist**

- "Live feed or link to facebook feed"
- More profound "About Wines" Section. "I would like something there that I woul imagine would be more descript about each of the varietals we carry, specific to each vintage year.  And maybe their availability ie 'in stock' vs 'out of stock'"
- No need for a sales section

**From Stuart**

- More Structure definition between things.
- Will Call for pick-up.  Troublesome pick-up and delivery system.  Submit and order, submit a request with name on it, you come in , you pay, you are in and you are out.  Name: First, Last, Capcha, Email and/or Phone (Disclaimer: This information will not be used.)
